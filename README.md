# Practice on an old kaggle competition
## As an assignment from General Assembly Data Science Immersive School
### This work is still a WIP

## Objective
Using data. Find patterns and predict the next mosquito hotspot areas and whether disease would be present.

# Machine Learning Frameworks used
- SKLearn
- Tensorflow
- XGBoost

## Machine Learning Applications:
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection using random forests
- Validation / Cross-Validations
- Hyperparameter tunings, GridSearch
- Model Selection

## Ensemble and model stacking
I apply cross validation and perform model ensemble for various models then use a meta learner to learn the output of these models to achieve an even higher predictive accuracy

# Predicting the next mosquito hotspots using past data.
## As an assignment from General Assembly Data Science Immersive School


## Objective
Using data. Find patterns and predict the next mosquito hotspot areas and whether disease would be present.

# Machine Learning Frameworks used
- SKLearn

## Machine Learning Applications:
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection using random forests
- Validation / Cross-Validations
- Hyperparameter tunings, GridSearch
- Model Selection

## Ensemble and model stacking
I apply cross validation and perform model ensemble for various models then use a meta learner to learn the output of these models to achieve an even higher predictive accuracy.
- Used an ensemble of random forest classifiers and sklearn without having to resort to deep learning and yet still achieved a 99% accuracy.
